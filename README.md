# Marvel Game

Current Progress can be seen here, but it's only in alpha - http://baskey.co/marvel-game/

Using the Marvel API, I'm working on creating a simple Marvel card game as a background project and to develop my JavaScript skills.

1. User can choose a pack and will be awarded a Marvel character at random, a call to the Marvel API is then made to pull all the data on that specific character and they are awarded with a card. This is then added to their deck.

Future

2. User can save their session, and login in the future to keep their card(s) in their own personal deck.
4. The user will be able to take on Marvel villains (top trumps style) and receive adamantium coins.
5. User will be able to get additional cards:
* +1 to random ability (single use/common)
* +1 to 1 chosen ability (single use/rare)
* +1 to all abilities (single use/very rare)
* +1 to random ability (perm/extremely rare)
* +1 to chosen ability (perm/ultra rare)
* hero on loan (2 games)
* villain on loan (2 games)
* hero on loan (5 games)
* villain on loan (5 games)
6. User will be able to trade their cards with friends.
