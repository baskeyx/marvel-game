# Marvel Game

Current Progress can be seen here, but it's only in beta - http://baskey.co/marvel-game/

Using the Marvel API, I'm working on creating a simple Marvel card game as a background project and to develop my JavaScript skills.

1. User can choose a pack and will be awarded a Marvel character at random, a call to the Marvel API is then made to pull all the data on that specific character and they are awarded with a card. This is then added to their deck.
2. User can take part in a challenge (currently a random easy-medium) and battle them in a top trump style fight.

Future

3. User can save their session, and login in the future to keep their card(s) in their own personal deck.
4. Proper marvel themed challenges with set rewards (or chance at some bigger rewards e.g. can win a rare card on completion).
5. Once a user has completed a fight they will be awarded with adamantium coins, additional cards, these will include:
* +1 to random ability (single use/common)
* +1 to 1 chosen ability (single use/rare)
* +1 to all abilities (single use/very rare)
* +1 to random ability (perm/extremely rare)
* +1 to chosen ability (perm/ultra rare)
* hero/villain on loan (2 games)
* hero/villain on loan (5 games)
* heal one ability card - common
* heal/revive all abilities card - rare
* guarentee user goes first card - common

6. User will be able to trade their cards with friends.
7. User will be able to take on their friends
8. Google Analytics
9. Convert to React JS
