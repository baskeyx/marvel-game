Using the Marvel API, I'm working on creating a simple Marvel card game as a background project and to develop my JavaScript skills.

1. User can choose a pack and will be awarded a Marvel character at random, an call to the Marvel API is then made to pull all the data on that specific character and they are awarded with a card.

Future

2. User can save their session, and login in the future to keep their card(s) in their own personal deck.
3. The cards will get assigned with attributes from the Marvel Universe Powergrid (e.g: http://marvel.com/universe/Blade)
4. The user will be able to take on Marvel villains and recieve XP
5. User will be able to trade their cards with friends.
